# Cell_ml! A blazingly fast ml algorithm

Cell_ml is a proof of concept. It is a machine learning algorithm that works by particioning an input space into cells and computing a value for the cell. Because of its simplicity, it runs blazingly fast, albeit with worse performance than other methods. This proof of concept predicts the product of its two inputs.
